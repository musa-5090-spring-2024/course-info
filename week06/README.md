## Slides & Code Samples

- Main slides: https://musa-5090-spring-2024.github.io/presentation_slides/week06/SLIDES.html

- Additional slides about spatial data formats: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18R1x1_Pscpc_TyYi5NH1RBJA7OO8wsjlG1BhYTVrvfA/edit?usp=sharing

- Code samples:
  - in the [explore_phila_data/](explore_phila_data/) directory you'll find extract and prepare scripts for a few datasets. I recommend reviewing them in this order:
    - Extract & prepare scripts for PWD Parcels (the parcels are downloaded as a file).
    - Extract & prepare scripts for OPA Properties (the properties are downloaded as a CSV file with EPSG:2272 coords).
    - Extract & prepare scripts for L&I Permits (the permits are downloaded as a GeoPackage).
    - Extract & prepare scripts for SEPTA Bus and Rail data (the GTFS file requires some ... interesting code).

## In-class Exercise

Continue working on the [BigQuery & Carto](../week05/exercises/ex_load_data_into_bigquery.md) exercise. Refer to the tips in the previous week's README for help.
